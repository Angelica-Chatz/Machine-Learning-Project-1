- R 3.2.3

# Tasks:
- Dataset about the 1992 US Elections (demographics and voting patterns)
- Predict the winner of the elections and explain the result based on the population attributes that affected it more
- Steps performed in this project: 

  a) Feature engineering
  
  b) Descriptive Statistics Analysis
  
  c) Missing Values handling
  
  d) Outlier detection
  
  e) Correlation Check
  
  f) Training - Test split dataset (80% - 20%)
  
  g) Stepwise Feature Selection
  
  h) Logit Regression deployment
  
  i) Model Fit metrics
  
  j) Confusion Matrix
  
  k) Model Performance Metrics
  
  l) ROC Curve plot
  
  m) several visualizations (US map:candidate frequency by state, GLM diagnostics, etc.)
